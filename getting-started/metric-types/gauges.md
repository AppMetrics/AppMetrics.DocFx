# Gauges

A Gauge is simply an action that returns the instantaneous measure of a value, where the value abitrarily increases and decreases, for example CPU usage.

Gauges are ideal to use for measured values such as current memory usage, cpu usage, temperatures, disk space etc.

## Using Gauges

Which for example when using the [JSON formatter](../intro.md#configuring-a-web-host) would result in something similar to:

[!code-json[Main](../../src/samples/App.Metrics.Formatters.Json.Samples/GaugeExample.json)]

### Derived Gauges

Derived Gauges allow you to derive a value from another Gauge and using a transformation, calculate the measurement.

### Ratio Gauges

Ratio Gauges allow you to measure a Gauge with a measurement which is the ratio between two values.
